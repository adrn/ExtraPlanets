Extragalactic exoplanets

The proposed pointing for Campaign 8 of the K2 Mission presents an
unprecedented opportunity to discover and characterize planets transiting stars
belonging to the Sagittarius Stellar Stream (Sgr stream). The Sgr stream is a
well-studied tidal debris structure that wraps around the entire Milky Way and
is detected in many different stellar populations (from main sequence to M and
K giant stars). The nearest sections of the stream visible in Field 8 span a
range of distances from 10-30 kpc, closer than satellite galaxies around the
Milky Way but still many times the distance of the farthest known transiting
exoplanets. However, even at these distances, K2 will be able to easily
observe giant stars (Kp ~ XX mag).

Co-I Foreman-Mackey was lead author on the first systematic search for
transiting exoplanets using the public K2 light curves (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2015).

For this purpose, the authors developed a method for robustly detecting
transiting exoplanets even in the face of large systematic noise introduced by
the pointing variations of the spacecraft.
This method enabled the discovery of candidate exoplanets transiting all but
the faintest targets.

Most of the stars belonging to The Stream are too faint to reliably discover
planets but even a single discovery, as the first known exoplanet of
extragalactic origin, would be of great scientific interest.
