Extragalactic exoplanets

The proposed pointing for Campaign 8 of the K2 Mission presents an
unprecedented opportunity to discover and characterize planets transiting stars
belonging to the Sagittarius Stellar Stream.
TODO: some words about Sagittarius.

Co-I Foreman-Mackey was lead author on the first systematic search for
transiting exoplanets using the public K2 light curves (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2015).
For this purpose, the authors developed a method for robustly detecting
transiting exoplanets even in the face of large systematic noise introduced by
the pointing variations of the spacecraft.
This method enabled the discovery of candidate exoplanets transiting all but
the faintest targets.

Most of the stars belonging to The Stream are too faint to reliably discover
planets but even a single discovery, as the first known exoplanet of
extragalactic origin, would be of great scientific interest.
